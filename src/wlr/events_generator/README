This directory contains scripts and programs that were used to generate
events.h and listener.h.

To run these scripts, you need to clone wlroots, configure it and build it.
For example:

  git clone https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots.git
  mkdir build
  WLROOTS_BUILDDIR=$PWD/build
  cd wlroots
  WLROOTS_DIR=$PWD

  CPUS=$(nproc)

  meson setup --backend ninja --buildtype=debug --clearcache -Drenderers=vulkan --prefix=/usr "$WLROOTS_BUILDDIR" "$WLROOTS_DIR"
  ninja -C "$WLROOTS_BUILDDIR" -j $CPUS

Then begin with running `renamer.sh`:

  ./renamer.sh $WLROOTS_DIR $WLROOTS_BUILDDIR

This should produce a file in the current directory called `renamer.out`
with content like:

wlr_multi_backend, backend_add, ../wlroots/backend/multi/backend.c:268
wlr_multi_backend, backend_remove, ../wlroots/backend/multi/backend.c:280
wlr_drm_lease, destroy, ../wlroots/backend/drm/drm.c:2188
wlr_device, change, ../wlroots/backend/session/session.c:216
wlr_device, remove, ../wlroots/backend/session/session.c:225
...etc

Those line numbers must match the current source tree of wlroots when
running analyzer; therefore - if wlroots is significantly changed (aka,
new signals have been added) - always run renamer.sh first, followed
by analyzer, after updating the wlroots git repository.

Thus, after (re)generating renamer.out, run:

  g++ -std=c++20 analyzer.cpp -o analyzer
  ./analyzer $WLROOTS_BUILDDIR renamer.out | LC_ALL=C sort > analyzer.out

The generation of events.h and listener.h is performed from custom rules
in the CMakeLists.txt of src/wlr, using this analyzer.out file.
